glib_cv_long_long_format=[ll]
# Format used by printf() and scanf() for 64 bit integers. "ll" is the C99 standard, and what is used by the 'trio' library that GLib builds if your printf() is insufficiently capable. Doesn't need to be set if you are compiling using trio.

glib_cv_stack_grows=[no]
# Whether the stack grows up or down. Most places will want "no", A few architectures, such as PA-RISC need "yes".

glib_cv_working_bcopy=[no]
# Whether your bcopy() can handle overlapping copies. Only needs to be set if you don't have memmove(). (Very unlikely)

glib_cv_sane_realloc=[yes]
# Whether your realloc() conforms to ANSI C and can handle NULL as the first argument. Defaults to "yes" and probably doesn't need to be set.

glib_cv_have_strlcpy=[no]
# Whether you have strlcpy() that matches OpenBSD. Defaults to "no", which is safe, since GLib uses a built-in version in that case.

glib_cv_have_qsort_r=[no]
# Whether you have qsort_r() that matches BSD. Defaults to "no", which is safe, since GLib uses a built-in version in that case.

glib_cv_va_val_copy=[yes]
# Whether va_list can be copied as a pointer. If set to "no", then memcopy() will be used. Only matters if you don't have va_copy() or __va_copy(). (So, doesn't matter for GCC.) Defaults to "yes" which is slightly more common than "no".

glib_cv_rtldglobal_broken=[no].
# Whether you have a bug found in OSF/1 v5.0. Defaults to "no".

glib_cv_uscore=[no]
# Whether an underscore needs to be prepended to symbols when looking them up via dlsym(). Only needs to be set if your system uses dlopen()/dlsym().

ac_cv_func_posix_getpwuid_r=[yes]
# Whether you have a getpwuid_r function (in your C library, not your thread library) that conforms to the POSIX spec. (Takes a 'struct passwd **' as the final argument)

ac_cv_func_nonposix_getpwuid_r=[no]
# Whether you have some variant of getpwuid_r() that doesn't conform to to the POSIX spec, but GLib might be able to use (or might segfault.) Only needs to be set if ac_cv_func_posix_getpwuid_r is not set. It's safest to set this to "no".

ac_cv_func_posix_getgrgid_r=[yes]
# Whether you have a getgrgid_r function that conforms to the POSIX spec.

glib_cv_use_pid_surrogate=[yes]
# Whether to use a setpriority() on the PID of the thread as a method for setting the priority of threads. This only needs to be set when using POSIX threads.

ac_cv_func_printf_unix98=[no]
# Whether your printf() family supports Unix98 style %N$ positional parameters. Defaults to "no".

ac_cv_func_vsnprintf_c99=[yes]
# Whether you have a vsnprintf() with C99 semantics. (C99 semantics means returning the number of bytes that would have been written had the output buffer had enough space.) Defaults to "no".
